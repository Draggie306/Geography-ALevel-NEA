# Geography-ALevel-NEA
A small repo for code that I write for my A-level Geography coursework/non-examined assessment (NEA)

# How to run
Firstly, clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/Draggie306/Geography-ALevel-NEA.git`

Then, run `pip -r requirements.txt` to install deps

Make sure the code has bool `repl_save` to `True` if you're running on a linux distro like replit

You might want to change the parameters in the `WordCloud` function from an 8K output to something smaller like:

```py
    width=1920,  # This is a 1920x1080 16:9 monitor
    height=1080,  
    max_words=1000,
```

Raise an issue and then pull request
